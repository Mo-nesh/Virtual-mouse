üß± Database Schema Overview

 Tables:

- **users**  
  Stores user details such as name, role (learner/instructor), and status.

- **courses**  
  Contains information about courses like title, start & end dates, and creator.

- **modules**  
  Represents logical segments of each course.

- **assignments** *(not uploaded)*  
  Would include assignment details per module.

- **progress**  
  Tracks assignment completion, scores, and timestamps per student.

- **permissions**  
  Manages user access rights to different courses.


 üß™ SQL Queries Highlights

Here are some example SQL queries found in `sql question.docx`:

 ‚úÖ Retrieve Student‚Äôs Overall Progress
```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    c.title AS course_title,
    COUNT(a.assignment_id) AS total_assignments,
    COUNT(p.assignment_id) AS completed_assignments,
    ROUND(COUNT(p.assignment_id) / COUNT(a.assignment_id) * 100, 2) AS completion_percentage
FROM users u
JOIN progress p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
JOIN assignments a ON a.assignment_id = p.assignment_id
JOIN modules m ON m.module_id = a.module_id
JOIN courses c ON c.course_id = m.course_id
WHERE u.user_id = 1
GROUP BY u.user_id, c.course_id;
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    COUNT(p.assignment_id) AS completed_assignments,
    AVG(p.score) AS average_score
FROM users u
JOIN progress p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id
HAVING COUNT(p.assignment_id) < 3 OR AVG(p.score) < 50;
SELECT 
    WEEK(p.completed_at) AS week_number,
    COUNT(*) AS completed_assignments
FROM progress p
WHERE p.user_id = 1342 AND p.completed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY WEEK(p.completed_at)
ORDER BY week_number;
